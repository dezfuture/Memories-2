### This is the continued version of our MERN application the memories project.

#### Initial dependencies which we are going to install are ->

#### CLIENT:

- @material-ui/lab: for bringing the effects of pagination and some other things
- @material-ui-chip-input: Input for the tags.

> Continuing with the client side.

- First in the components folder we created the **pagination.jsx** and over there imported pagination and paginationItem and then we in the functional component passes the self closing Pagination component in which we also pass some props and then pass **PaginationItem** component and also made the styles.js file for the **ul** styling and now to render this we in the Home.js render it after the form component and in a **Paper** component.
